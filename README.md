## 👨‍💻 About Me

Backend engineer and co-founder with extensive experience building reliable production systems. I focus on **API design, distributed backend architectures, cloud-native deployments, and clean, maintainable code**.

I’m deeply involved in the full lifecycle of backend systems — from architectural decisions and infrastructure automation to delivering business value on systems used by real communities.
