## 👨‍💻 About Me

Technical co-founder responsible for backend, infrastructure, and production scalability with extensive experience building reliable production systems. I focus on **API design, distributed backend architectures, cloud-native deployments, and clean, maintainable code**.

I’m deeply involved in the full lifecycle of backend systems — from architectural decisions and infrastructure automation to delivering business value for real communities.

</h2>

As co-founder and core backend engineer at **Metastack**, I co-architected an esports SaaS platform used globally by competitive and casual players. Metastack provides a unified space to create, organize, and explore strategic game knowledge for Counter-Strike, helping users improve and collaborate securely.  

Key contributions:
- Co-architected backend and API design using Django & Django REST Framework  
- Optimized PostgreSQL queries with profilers (Silk, Django Debug Toolbar) and implemented caching for high-traffic routes  
- Built async workflows for image processing and background tasks, decoupled from request/response cycle  
- Designed and enforced multi-tenant, team-based subscription model with fine-grained access control to protect confidential team strategies  
- Led onboarding and mentoring of frontend and backend developers on architecture, infrastructure, and toolset usage  
- AWS infrastructure design, staging/production environment separation, containerized deployments, CI/CD automation (Jenkins)  
- Implemented observability and monitoring with CloudWatch metrics (task memory, CPU, Redis hit/miss ratios, DB pooling)  
- Event-driven communication using RabbitMQ, real-time collaboration via WebSockets  
- Security and access control strategy for sensitive team data  
- Established strategic partnerships with GRID, Faceit/ESEA leagues, and CSMoney
